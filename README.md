## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m an NLP practitioner focused on building intelligent systems that can understand and process human language. My work primarily involves text classification, information extraction, and building natural language pipelines using spaCy, one of the most powerful and flexible NLP libraries available in Python.

This space is where I share projects, experiments, and resources related to real-world NLP tasks. I'm especially interested in designing solutions that can classify, categorize, and extract meaning from large volumes of unstructured text. Whether it's sentiment analysis, topic classification, or custom entity recognition, I enjoy exploring how to turn raw text into structured, actionable data.

Most of the projects here are built using spaCy and often integrate with other tools and frameworks, such as Scikit-learn, FastAPI, and Hugging Face. I focus on building efficient, production-ready NLP componentsâ€”keeping things clean, modular, and well-documented. I also enjoy optimizing pipelines for speed and accuracy, and experimenting with custom spaCy components and pre-trained embeddings.

If you're learning NLP, curious about text classification, or interested in using spaCy in your own projects, feel free to explore the code, raise an issue, or open a discussion. I believe in open learning and sharing insights as I grow in this field. Collaboration and community are key to advancing how we work with language data.

Thanks for visiting the repository. I hope you find something useful, whether itâ€™s inspiration for your next project or a new way to solve a familiar problem.
